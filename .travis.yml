# Supply at least one RACKET_VERSION environment variable definition
# here. RACKET_VERSION is used by the install-racket.sh script
# (specifed below under before_install) to select the version of
# Racket to download and install.
#
# If you supply more than one, you can create multiple builds (a
# Travis-CI build matrix resulting in multiple builds). You can use
# this to test against multiple Racket versions.

# Here supply steps such as raco make, raco test, etc.  Note that you
# need to supply /usr/racket/bin/ -- it's not in PATH. You can run

# packages without it getting stuck on a confirmation prompt.
